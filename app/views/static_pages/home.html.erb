							<h2>Learn something new
							</h2>
							<p>Each month we invite a distinguished speaker from the local community to present their work on exciting new advancements. Our speakers are passionate about their topics and passing on their knowledge to the community. If you have a speaker that you'd really like to hear from, we'd be happy to reach out to them for a future Lynx event.

							<h2>Our goal is to make everyone feel welcome
							</h2>
							<p>Lynx is about building community during every one of our events. We encourage people to go beyond small talk to really get to know the other aspiring titleals in the room. The best connections are formed through genuine conversation, and you'd be surprised at how much you can learn just by spending the time to find out what each person has to say about their passions, their work, and their career aspirations.

						<p>Part of being a Lynx member is the ownership of the event and the community. We encourage you to help us create experiences around the topics that you're interested in exploring. Your time will be very valuably spent in fostering the Lynx community as well as putting yourself in a great position to meet and work with many quality individuals.
